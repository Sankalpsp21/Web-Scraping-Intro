# Web Scraping Intro
 
### Introduction

This was a little project to test out some webscraping and visualizing data. I had originally been just focused on learning data organizaiton and vizualization, however I tended to struggle finding the exact dataset I was looking for. I did a little digging an I was astounded to find a whole branch of computer science dedicated to data aquisition. This project specifically takes data about country area and population from [this site](https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/) puts it into a DataFrame, and creates a plot to see the trends. 

### The Webpage

### Final Thoughts
Although really simple, this project opened my eyes to thousands of possibilities. I really enjoyed it and am super excited to learn more about data aquisition and data science. Stay tuned for more!
